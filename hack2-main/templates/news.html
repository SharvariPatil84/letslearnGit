            At around Rs 21,000 crore annually, cardiac medication forms the biggest therapy of drugs being bought by
            Indians today. A decade ago, it was a third of its size and the second largest-therapy by sales. At around
            Rs 16,000 crore, anti-diabetes medication today is the fourth-largest therapy of drugs sold in the country,
            posting the maximum and an unfortunate surge among the leading therapies.

            The Growth Study is an ongoing prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study investigating sex
            differences in growth impairment in children with Crohn's disease. For their current analysis, lead author
            Dr. Neera Gupta, principal investigator for The Growth Study, director of research for the Pediatric
            Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine
            and a pediatric gastroenterologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Komansky Children's Hospitals, and colleagues
            examined a range of variables associated with statural growth by
            sex for 113 children with Crohn's disease, such as disease characteristics, patient-reported symptoms at
            onset and the use of certain medications.

            The thin, flexible, lightweight device could be used in patients who need temporary pacing after cardiac
            surgery or while waiting for a permanent pacemaker. All components of the pacemaker are biocompatible and
            naturally absorb into the body's biofluids over the course of five to seven weeks, without needing surgical
            extraction.The device wirelessly harvests energy from an external, remote antenna using near-field
            communication
            protocols -- the same technology used in smartphones for electronic payments and in RFID tags. This
            eliminates the need for bulky batteries and rigid hardware, including wires (or leads). Not only can leads
            introduce infections, they also can become enveloped in scar tissue, causing further damage when removed.

            Currently, the diagnosis of a thyroid nodule is performed using a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) using
            an ultrasound image. But about 20% of FNABs are inaccurate which leads to repetitive and unnecessary
            biopsies.
            To overcome this problem, the joint research team explored the use of PA imaging to obtain an ultrasonic
            signal generated by light. When light (laser) is irradiated on the patient's thyroid nodule, an ultrasound
            signal called a PA signal is generated from the thyroid gland and the nodule are collected. At this time, if
            multispectral PA signals are obtained, oxygen saturation information of the thyroid gland and thyroid nodule
            can be calculated.
